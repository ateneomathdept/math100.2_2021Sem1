    "1. Upload the complete Jupyter notebook to the appropriate submission bin on Canvas on or before **November 12, 2021 (Friday) 11:59 PM**.\n",
    "2. Make sure that your notebook is organized, well-documented and clearly-annotated.\n",
    "3. Your notebook should show all codes required for Parts 1, 2, and 3. The answers for Part 2 should be displayed in your Notebook. For questions requiring some analysis/explanation (Part 3), make sure to write your detailed paragraphs (and display your graphs) in [markdown cells](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells.htm). \n",
    "4. The filename for your Jupyter notebook should follow this format: `ma1002_[lastnameofTeamMember1]_[lastnameofTeamMember2]_[lastnameofTeamMember3 (if any)]_Project1.ipynb`\n",
    "5. Include comments (using the # symbol) in your codes so that it will be easier for the instructors to understand them. For your helper functions, use descriptive [docstrings](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings) to clarify what they do.\n",
    "6. Make sure to include the following in a markdown cell at the start of your notebook:\n",
    "* Your names\n",
    "* Names of the people you asked help from\n",
    "* Resources (e.g., websites, books) you used/consulted for this project\n",
