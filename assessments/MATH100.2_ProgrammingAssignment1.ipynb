    "# Submission Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload the complete Jupyter notebook to the appropriate submission bin in Canvas on or before <font color='red'>**September 30, 2021 (Thursday) 11:59 PM**</font>.\n",
    "2. Make sure that your notebook is organized, well-documented and clearly-annotated.\n",
    "3. Your notebook should show all the code required for Parts 1 and 2. The answers for Part 2 should be displayed in your Notebook. For questions requiring some analysis/explanation, write your answers in [markdown cells](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells.htm). \n",
    "4. The filename for your Jupyter notebook should follow this format: \\\n",
    "`math100_[section]_[lastname]_PA1.ipynb`\n",
    "5. Include comments (using the # symbol) in the body of your code so that it will be easier for the instructor to understand your code. For your helper functions, write a descriptive [docstring](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings) similar to the ones below. \n",
    "6. Make sure to indicate in a markdown cell at the start of your notebook your name, as well as the names of the people you have asked help from and the online websites you have used in solving the problem. Here is an example:\n",
